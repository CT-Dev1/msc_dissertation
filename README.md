# thesis

This repository is for my postgraduate thesis "A Longitudinal Network Analysis of Online Collective Action: Redditâ€™s r/amcstock Community"

It seeks to investigate the collective action dynamics of r/amcstock in relation to the successful shortsqueeze achieved in June 2021.

This is currently a early-stage version of the code. It will be updated as my methods are finalized in the coming months. I will update periodically. 

All data is derived from the push shift data dump at academic torrents, includes all 2021 comments and submissions, here is the [link](https://academictorrents.com/details/9c263fc85366c1ef8f5bb9da0203f4c8c8db75f4)
