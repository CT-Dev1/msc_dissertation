# thesis

This repository is for my postgraduate thesis "A Longitudinal Network Analysis of Online Collective Action: Redditâ€™s r/amcstock Community"

It seeks to investigate the collective action dynamics of r/amcstock in relation to the successful shortsqueeze achieved in June 2021.

The primary documents are:
- parsing script to convert pushshift zst compressed file into igraph R objects
- analysis script to run a latent space dynamic network model to simulate longitudinal network changes
- algorithm to detect post-types in r/amcstock to find commitment signalling

This is currently a early-stage version of the code. It will be updated as my methods are finalized in the coming month.
